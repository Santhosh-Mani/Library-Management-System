The objective is to construct a library management application with a database backend to hold data on users, documents, and other items. We collect data for a single library's patrons for this project. The purpose of Online Library Management is to computerize, automate, and handle all other processes related to the management of member information, book issuance, and book returns. In many cases, the library's maintenance is made more accessible by computerization. Due to a significant reduction in manual labor, it lessens management's workload. The library's books, reports, journal articles, magazines, and theses are arranged systematically, and the library management system makes it possible to keep track of them. They have characteristics like authors, editors, edition, type, year of publication, etc. With the help of Java and MySQL, the project seeks to create and put into use a library management system that allows librarians and users to log in. Members and documents can be added, viewed, searched for, and deleted by librarians. Members may borrow, examine, search for, and return documents.
